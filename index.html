    <p> Welcome to my simple website. I try to keep it informal and light here, because there's already
        a lot of seriousness in the world, plus it's more fun this way.
    <br><br>
    This site is perpetually under construction (as am I).

<h2 class="w3-center"> About me</h2>
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-16" style="font-size: 80%;">
    <p> My full name is David Ignacio Iglesias Echevarria (Spanish naming customs use one last name from each parent (Iglesias - dad, Echevarria - mom)).
    My name is pronounced dah-beed - no need to feel bad if you've used the English pronunciation (unless I've explicitly told you the correct one lol). 
    I'm originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lleida">Lleida</a>, 
    a beautiful, historical town in Catalonia, Spain, and lived in Barcelona and Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Bay Area.

    <br><br> My professional interests lie in the areas of autonomy and artificial intelligence, specializing mainly in perception, localization, and mapping.
    I think robotics (as in, embodied intelligence) has the potential to positively transform societies and economies throughout the world, and so spending time accelerating
    progress in this field is a worthy thing.
    
    <br><br> I got my Master's degree in Robotics from the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I did research in cooperative pose estimation for multi-robot systems in bandwidth-constrained environments,
    under <a href="https://cohrint.info/"> Prof. Nisar Ahmed</a> (check out his research, it's cool!) Before that, I did my undergrad in Aerospace Engineering at 
    <a href=https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en>UPC-BarcelonaTech</a>, motivated by my love of space exploration and systems that operate in the real world under
    physical constraints.
    
    <br><br> My CV is available upon request. If you want to contact me for professional reasons, you can <a href="mailto:iglesias.david.ignacio@gmail.com">shoot
    me an email</a>.

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-16" style="font-size: 80%;">
    <p>
        Always learning...
    <ul>
    <li><b>Sr. Software Engineer - Localization & Mapping</b>, <i>XPeng Motors</i>, Santa Clara, US<div class="w3-right">Dec 2020 - present</div></li>
    This has been my longest stint to date by far (still going!), so there's too much to cover in detail (feel free to ask
    me for additional info, though). During my time here, I've worked on both improving legacy solutions as well as prototyping +
    testing + deploying new ones. This has been mostly in two areas. One, localization, where I've worked on absolute positioning (
    using GPS/GNSS), dead-reckoning (in GPS-denied environments), and calibration. Two, mapping, where I've worked on road surface estimation
    and, more generally, building reliable and accurate local maps around the vehicle. I've also spent big chunks of time defining, implementing,
    and maintaining metrics for both pose smoothness and accuracy, and for lane line quality and consistency. This latter stuff is sometimes glossed over,
    as it is less glamorous than other parts of the stack, but in my opinion is one of the most critical, less well understood ones.
    <br><br>
    <li>Offer I received from a certain company got rescinded in March 2020, so I decided to take the opportunity and work on side projects
        for a few months instead of desperately applying for my next position. This turned out to be a great decision on all levels</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Computer Vision Engineer</b>, <i>Verdant Robotics</i>, Hayward, US<div class="w3-right">Feb 2019 - Mar 2020</div></li>
    Being one of the first 10 employees at the company during its first year, I had to wear many hats. From data collection and annotating,
    to setting up Jenkins pipelines and writing real-time rendering applications for 3d visualization. Most of it revolved around
    using cameras and other sensors, writing the drivers and APIs for data collection, as well as writing
    calibration libraries for multi-camera and multi-sensor systems. I also worked on various applications that relied on
    image processing techniques like foreground extraction, instance segmentation, and multi-object tracking
    <br><br>
    <li><b>Software Engineer</b>, <i>Point One Navigation</i>, San Francisco, US<div class="w3-right">Jan 2018 - Jan 2019</div></li>
    Point One provides a precise localization solution for various applications. I worked across a few areas: tooling,
    testing, multi-sensor calibration (both offline and online)
    </ul>

    <p>
    Random and totally incomplete facts about me.
    <ul>
    <li>I speak English, Catalan, and Spanish. Used to be fluent in French too (would spend the summers
        in France, in my teenage years), but it's been too long (désolé, French friends :()
    </li><br>
    <li>I'm a big football (erm, soccer...) fan, particularly of FC Barcelona and the Spanish National Team
    </li><br>
    <li>I really like video games. I won't die on this hill, but the best 1-2 year period for video games imo is
        2004-2005 (nostalgia may be a factor to consider here...)
    </li><br>
    <li>I don't particularly read too much these days, but I'm constantly planning what to read next. The corollary
        here is that my reading list is only getting longer
    </li><br>
    <li>If I could time-travel and spend one hour in any previous time of my life, I'd go back to an arbitrary school
        day in the mid 2000s. Be at home for lunch and have my mom's food while the news play in the back and my dad takes a short nap on the couch.
        The late spring sun is coming in, the days are getting longer and warmer, and the semester is coming to an end. Life's good :_)
    </li><br>
    <li>Some things I like: ambient and video game music, exploring big cities, hole-in-the-wall food places,
        espresso, tea (mostly Chinese and Japanese), hot and dry summer days with the sounds of cicadas and owls and the smell
        of pine and cypress trees (anything that reminds me of the Mediterranean, really), the internet 
        of the late 90s and 00s and its aesthetics, Indian-Pakistani food and music, swimming in rivers and streams in the
        Pyrenees, gardening, straightforwardness, family, meandering lists of things, self-reference...
    </li>
    </ul>
