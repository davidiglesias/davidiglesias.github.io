    <p><br> Welcome to my website. I try to keep it informal and light here, because there's already
        a lot of seriousness in the world, plus it's more fun this way.

    <p>
    This site is perpetually under construction (as am I).

<h2 class="w3-center"> About me</h2>
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-8" style="font-size: 80%;">
    <p>My full name is <b>David Ignacio Iglesias Echevarria</b>.
    My name is pronounced dah-beed, emphasis on the second syllable - no need to feel bad if you've pronounced it differently (unless I've explicitly told you the correct one lol). 
    I'm originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lleida">Lleida</a>, 
    a beautiful, historical town in Catalonia, Spain, and lived in Barcelona and Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Bay Area.</p>

    <p>My professional interests lie in the areas of autonomy and artificial intelligence, specializing mainly in perception, localization, and mapping.
    I think robotics (as in, embodied intelligence) has the potential to positively transform societies and economies throughout the world, so spending time accelerating
    progress in the field is a generally worthy pursuit.</p>
    
    <p>I got my Master's degree in Robotics from the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado, Boulder</a>, where I did research in cooperative pose estimation for multi-robot systems in bandwidth-constrained environments,
    under <a href="https://cohrint.info/"> Prof. Nisar Ahmed</a> (check out his research, it's cool!) Before that, I did my undergrad in Aerospace Engineering at 
    <a href=https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en>UPC-BarcelonaTech</a>, driven by my love of space exploration and systems that operate in the real world under
    physical constraints.</p>
    
    <p>My CV is available upon request. For any professional inquiries, you can email me at firstlastnamedotfirstnamedotmiddlenameatgmaildotcom (there are no typos.)</a></p>

    <li><b>XPeng Motors</b>, Santa Clara, US</li>
    <i>Staff Software Engineer</i> <div class="w3-right">Aug 2024 - present</div>
    <br>
    As the technical roadmap and business goals (and in turn the day-to-day work) at the company have changed over time, I've
    also shifted to a much more deep learning-heavy role. There's a lot I can't
    disclose for obvious reasons, but I'm currently mostly focused on the overseas product and the work ahead is exciting!
    <br><br>
    <i>Senior Software Engineer - Localization & Mapping</i> <div class="w3-right">Dec 2020 - Aug 2024</div>
    <br>
    As a member of the Localization & Mapping team, I worked on both improving legacy solutions as well as prototyping +
    testing + deploying new ones. 
    <br><br>
    On the localization side, I worked on absolute positioning (using GPS/GNSS), dead-reckoning (in GPS-denied environments), and calibration. This was pretty early on in my time here, so the code base was pretty green
    and a lot of the stuff was implemented from scratch - it was fun.
    <br><br>
    On the mapping side, I worked on road surface estimation
    and, more generally, building reliable and accurate local maps around the vehicle. 
    <br><br>
    All throughout, in parallel, I spent big chunks of time defining, implementing,
    and maintaining metrics for both pose smoothness and accuracy, and for lane line quality and temporal/geometric consistency. This latter stuff is sometimes seen as
    less exciting, but imo is critical and every single person should write their own metrics and tests, since it forces you to think about
    what "good" is at a low level.
    <br><br>
    <li>In <b>March of 2020</b>, at the onset of the covid pandemic, I received an offer that was rescinded a few days before I was supposed to start.
    I decided to use the unique circumstances to work on side projects for a few months and figure out what I wanted to do next. This turned out
    to be a great decision.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Verdant Robotics</b>, Hayward, US</li>
    <i>Computer Vision Engineer</i><div class="w3-right">Feb 2019 - Mar 2020</div>
    <br>
    Being one of the first 10 employees at the company during its first year, I had to wear many hats. From data collection and annotating,
    to setting up Jenkins pipelines and writing real-time rendering applications for 3d visualization. Most of it revolved around
    using cameras and other sensors, writing the drivers and APIs for data collection, and writing
    calibration libraries for multi-camera and multi-sensor systems. I also worked on visual multi-object tracking, foreground extraction, and instance segmentation.
    <br><br>
    <li><b>Point One Navigation</b>, San Francisco, US</li>
    <i>Software Engineer</i> <div class="w3-right">Jan 2018 - Jan 2019</div>
    <br>
    Point One provides a precise localization solution for various applications. I worked across a few areas: real-time positioning, multi-sensor calibration (both offline and online),
    tooling, and testing.
    </ul>

    <ul>
    <li>I speak English, Catalan, and Spanish. Used to be fluent in French too (I spent a few summers
        in France as part of various exchange programs in high school), but it's been too long without any practice :(
    </li><br>
    <li>I'm a big football (erm, soccer...) fan, particularly of FC Barcelona and the Spanish National Team
    </li><br>
    <li>I like video games. I won't die on this hill, but the best 1-2 year period for video games imo is
        2004-2005 (nostalgia may be a factor to consider here...)
    </li><br>
    <li>I don't particularly read too much these days, but I'm constantly planning what to read next. The corollary
        here is that my reading list is only getting longer
    </li><br>
    <li>If I could time-travel and spend one hour in any previous time of my life, I'd go back to an arbitrary school
        day in the mid 2000s. Be at home for lunch and have my mom's food while the news play in the back and my dad takes a short nap on the couch.
        The late spring sun is coming in, the days are getting longer and warmer, and the semester is coming to an end. Life's good :_)
    </li><br>
    <li>Some things I like: ambient and video game music, exploring big cities, hole-in-the-wall food places,
        espresso, tea (mostly Chinese and Japanese), hot and dry summer days with the sounds of cicadas and owls and the smell
        of pine and cypress trees (anything that reminds me of the Mediterranean, really), the internet 
        of the late 90s and 00s and its aesthetics, South Asian food and music, hiking in the
        Pyrenees, gardening, straightforwardness, family, meandering lists of things, self-reference...
    </li>
