    My full name is David (Spanish pronunciation: daˈβið) Ignacio Iglesias Echevarria. I also respond to
    Dawood (daː'wuːd), the Arabic version of my name, or, begrudgingly, to the English pronunciation. I'm originally
    from a small town near Barcelona, Spain,
    and lived in Boulder, Colorado, before moving to the Bay Area.
    <br><br> My professional interests lie in the areas of robot perception and motion estimation. I think robotics has
    the potential to transform societies and economies throughout the world, and am particularly motivated to work on
    projects that aim
    at solving or relieving issues that affect disadvantaged communities.
    <br><br> I got my Master's degree in aerospace engineering, concentrating in astrodynamics and space engineering, at
    CU Boulder (sko buffs!). My thesis was in the area of cooperative robot localization in GPS-denied environments.
    <br><br> If you want to contact me for professional reasons, <a href="mailto:iglesias.david.ignacio@gmail.com">shoot
        me an email</a>.
